## ✨ What Makes This Framework Different

This framework goes beyond simple prompting rules. It's a complete operational system that:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **System Thinking** | Every action considers end-to-end impact |
| ✅ **Evidence-Based** | Trust is earned through verification, not assumptions |
| 🤖 **True Autonomy** | Agents make decisions within clear guardrails |
| 📈 **Continuous Learning** | Built-in feedback loops improve the framework itself |
| 🔧 **Scalable** | Adapts from simple tasks to architectural changes |

---

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

The framework consists of three integrated layers:

### 1. 📋 The Engineering Manifest

The foundational constitution that defines agent behavior, decision-making protocols, and quality standards.

**📄 [manifest.md](manifest.md)** | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/manifest.md) | [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/manifest.md)

**Installation:**
- 🌐 **Global (Recommended):** Install as a global rule in your AI environment
- 📁 **Project-Specific:** Place in `.cursor/rules/` or project root `AGENT.md`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Treat the Manifest as infrastructure-as-code. When updating, replace the entire file to prevent configuration drift.

---

### 2. 🔄 Workflow Templates

Structured execution templates that guide agents through specific task types.

**Status Indicators:**
- `✅` - Objective completed successfully
- `⚠️` - Issue encountered and resolved autonomously
- `🚧` - Blocked, requires human input
- `🔍` - Investigation in progress

| Workflow | Purpose | When to Use | Links |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **🔨 build.md** | Feature development & system enhancement | Creating new features, refactoring, planned improvements | [View](workflows/build.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/workflows/build.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/workflows/build.md) |
| **🔍 diagnose.md** | Deep debugging & root cause analysis | Persistent bugs, system failures, complex issues | [View](workflows/diagnose.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/workflows/diagnose.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/workflows/diagnose.md) |
| **🔄 migrate.md** | Data migration & system transformation | Database migrations, schema changes, data transformations | [View](workflows/migrate.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/workflows/migrate.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/workflows/migrate.md) |
| **📈 evolve.md** | Framework improvement & learning capture | End of session to improve the framework itself | [View](workflows/evolve.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/workflows/evolve.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/workflows/evolve.md) |

### 3. 🎛️ Behavior Modifiers

Optional, stackable behavior adjustments for specific communication styles or operational modes.

| Modifier | Effect | Links |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **⚡ terse.md** | Ultra-concise, information-dense communication | [View](modifiers/terse.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/modifiers/terse.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/modifiers/terse.md) |
| **💼 professional.md** | Eliminates sycophantic language and filler | [View](modifiers/professional.md) \| [GitHub](https://github.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/blob/main/modifiers/professional.md) \| [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moeidsaleem/agentic-engineering-framework/main/modifiers/professional.md) |

## 🚀 Quick Start: Your First Session

### Step 1: Install the Manifest

Copy the contents of [`manifest.md`](manifest.md) into your Cursor rules (global or project-specific).

### Step 2: Choose Your Workflow

Select the appropriate workflow template:
- **🔨 Building something new?** → Use [`workflows/build.md`](workflows/build.md)
- **🔍 Debugging a persistent issue?** → Use [`workflows/diagnose.md`](workflows/diagnose.md)
- **🔄 Migrating data?** → Use [`workflows/migrate.md`](workflows/migrate.md)
- **📈 Wrapping up a session?** → Use [`workflows/evolve.md`](workflows/evolve.md)

### Step 3: Customize and Execute

1. Open the workflow file
2. Replace the mission placeholder with your specific goal
3. (Optional) Append a modifier if you need specific behavior
4. Paste the entire text into your chat
5. Observe the structured execution

### Step 4: Review and Learn

After completion, use [`workflows/evolve.md`](workflows/evolve.md) to capture learnings and improve the framework.

---

## 📊 The Execution Model

Every workflow follows a structured execution model:

```
1. Discovery Phase    → Non-destructive investigation of current state
2. Strategy Phase     → Planning with risk assessment and dependency mapping
3. Execution Phase    → Autonomous implementation with continuous verification
4. Validation Phase   → Comprehensive testing and system consistency checks
5. Documentation      → Update docs, clean workspace, report findings
```

Each phase must complete before proceeding. Blockers are escalated immediately with specific questions.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **🔬 Evidence Over Assumption** - Every decision backed by investigation
2. **🌐 System-Wide Ownership** - Fix entire problem chains, not just symptoms
3. **🤖 Autonomous Execution** - Act within guardrails, escalate only when truly blocked
4. **✅ Continuous Verification** - Test as you build, verify before completion
5. **📈 Self-Improvement** - Framework evolves based on real-world usage

## 🎨 Advanced Usage

### Stacking Modifiers

You can combine multiple modifiers for specific scenarios:

```markdown
[workflow content]
---
[modifier 1 content]
---
[modifier 2 content]
```

### Custom Workflows

Create project-specific workflows by adapting the templates. Maintain the core execution model but customize phases for your domain.

### Manifest Customization

The Manifest can be extended with project-specific rules. Add sections that complement (don't contradict) the core principles.
