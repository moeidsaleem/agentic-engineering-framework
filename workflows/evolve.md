# Evolve Workflow: Framework Improvement & Learning Capture

**Mission:** Analyze this session and improve the framework if durable lessons were learned.

---

## Context

This workflow is used at the end of a session to capture learnings and improve the framework itself. The goal is continuous improvement based on real-world usage.

---

## Execution Model

This workflow analyzes the session, evaluates the framework, and updates it if needed. Announce phase transitions clearly.

---

## Phase 1: Session Analysis

**Objective:** Identify what worked well and what didn't.

**Actions:**
1. **Review the Session**
   - What tasks were completed?
   - What challenges were encountered?
   - What decisions were made?
   - What assumptions were proven wrong?
   - What patterns emerged?

2. **Identify Patterns**
   - What worked well? (Should be reinforced)
   - What didn't work? (Should be improved)
   - What was unclear? (Should be clarified)
   - What was missing? (Should be added)

3. **Extract Durable Lessons**
   - Not one-off issues, but patterns
   - Not project-specific, but general principles
   - Not temporary workarounds, but lasting improvements
   - Actionable insights that improve future sessions

**Deliverable:** Session analysis with:
- What worked (patterns to reinforce)
- What didn't work (patterns to improve)
- Durable lessons (generalizable insights)

**Status:**
- `✅` - Analysis complete, lessons identified
- `⚠️` - Analysis complete, but no clear lessons
- `🚧` - Cannot analyze (escalate)

---

## Phase 2: Framework Evaluation

**Objective:** Determine if the manifest should be updated.

**Actions:**
1. **Review Lessons Against Manifest**
   - Is this already covered? (Maybe needs clarification)
   - Is this missing? (Should be added)
   - Is this contradicted? (Should be updated)
   - Does this improve existing guidance?

2. **Evaluate Update Necessity**
   - Is this a durable lesson? (Not a one-off)
   - Is this generalizable? (Applies beyond this session)
   - Is this important? (Worth adding to manifest)
   - Does this improve the framework?

3. **Propose Updates (If Needed)**
   - Specific changes to manifest.md
   - Explanation of why this improves the framework
   - Before/after comparison if helpful
   - Location in manifest where change should go

**Deliverable:** Framework evaluation with:
- Comparison of lessons vs. current manifest
- Proposed updates (if any) with rationale
- Impact assessment

**Status:**
- `✅` - Manifest update proposed
- `⚠️` - No update needed (lesson already covered or not durable)
- `🚧` - Unclear if update needed (escalate)

---

## Phase 3: Manifest Update (If Applicable)

**Objective:** Update manifest.md with the proposed improvements.

**Actions:**
1. **Read Current Manifest**
   - Understand current structure
   - Identify where changes should go
   - Ensure consistency with existing content

2. **Make Updates**
   - Implement proposed changes
   - Maintain consistency
   - Update version number and date
   - Preserve existing valuable content

3. **Document the Change**
   - What was changed?
   - Why was it changed?
   - What session/lesson prompted it?
   - Version history note

**Deliverable:** Updated manifest with:
- Changes implemented
- Version updated
- Change documented

**Status:**
- `✅` - Manifest updated
- `⚠️` - Update deferred (needs review)
- `🚧` - Update blocked (escalate)
